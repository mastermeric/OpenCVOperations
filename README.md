# OpenCVOperations
Various OpenCV Operations in Java such as face detection, OCR (Optic Character Recognition) etc..

Don't forget to create your own "images" "data" fodlers to store related files.
"images"  folder contains some sample image files to operate on it.
"data" folder has "haarcascade_frontalface_alt2.xml"  fiel for face detection


Thank you..
